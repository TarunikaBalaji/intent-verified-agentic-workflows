# Intent-Verified Agentic Workflows on Icarus

This repository contains a prototype implementation for an intent-verified agentic workflow system,
built for the East India Blockchain Summit (EIBS) 2.0 – Weilliptic Track.

## Overview
The system ensures that every AI agent action is:
- Pre-declared as an intent
- Verified on-chain using policy rules
- Executed only after approval
- Fully auditable via immutable records

Note: This is a hackathon prototype aligned with the official EIBS problem statement.
